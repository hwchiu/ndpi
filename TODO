1. Missing function to select (or exclude) protocols from the search.

2. Missing function to guess a protocol based on the port number, when no protocol was found.

3. Missing "first guess" to start examinating packets from a protocol, which fits regarding the port numbers.

4. Debug functions do not work so far.

5. Invoke dissectors only when needed in a tree.

6. Add ability to include user-defined protocols without prior re-compilation of the software.

7. Change the structure to include HTTPS as well:
SSL->HTTPS->Dropbox
SSL->POPS

8. Add proper certificates for TOR and other applications.

9. Multiple contents / services per flow.

10. Content and service providers

11. Custom content types and providers for non defined domains and fields.

12. Excluding protocols by a bitmask.

13. Make it working in Windows / Linux kernel.

14. The scanning process should stop when:
- either all the scanners are already excluded
- or every level is already detected.
But sometimes some results from some scanners should be overwritten by another scanners, just by not excluding the levels.
Make it conssitent in ndpi_main.c and the calling sample application.

15. Add support for IPv6 in the sample application.

16. Clean the src/dst state machine in the particular protocols and delete the entire structure.
