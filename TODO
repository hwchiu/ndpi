1. Finish clean-ups and code separation (every scanner-related issues should be contained by the scanners). Including:
- Clean the src/dst state machine in the particular protocols and delete the entire structure.

2. Missing function to select (or exclude) protocols from the search.

3. Missing "first guess" to start examinating packets from a protocol, which fits regarding the port numbers.

4. Debug functions do not work so far and they are very messy - we need to clean them up.

5. Invoke dissectors only when needed in a tree.

6. Add ability to include user-defined protocols without prior re-compilation of the software.

7. Change the structure to include HTTPS as well:
SSL->HTTPS->Dropbox
SSL->POPS

8. Improve detection of TOR and other applications.

9. Make it working in Windows / Linux kernel.

10. The scanning process should stop when:
- either all the scanners are already excluded
- or every level is already detected.
But sometimes some results from some scanners should be overwritten by another scanners, just by not excluding the levels (as RTMP and H323).

11. The sample application:
- Add support for IPv6.
- Add ability for non-limited number of flows.

12. Add DNS caching in order to detect service providers based on DNS replies.
