1. Missing function to select (or exclude) protocols from the search.

2. Missing function to guess a protocol based on the port number, when no protocol was found.

3. Missing "first guess" to start examinating packets from a protocol, which fits regarding the port numbers.

4. Debug functions do not work so far.

5. Invoke dissectors only when needed in a tree.

6. All the processing functions from original .c files in this directory.

7. Add ability to include user-defined protocols without prior re-compilation of the software.

8. Include all protocols from OpenDPI.

9. Change the structure to include HTTPS as well:
SSL->HTTPS->Dropbox
SSL->POPS

10. Add proper certificates for TOR and other applications.

11. Multiple contents / services per flow.

12. Content and service providers

13. Custom content types and providers for non defined domsins and fields.

14. Excluding protocols by a bitmask.

15. Make it working in Windows / Linux kernel.

16. Services should be matched by IP addresses only when otjher methods fail. That should be done after the last possible packet of the flow is processed or after 10 packets (what is faster).
