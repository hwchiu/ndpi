1. Missing function to select (or exclude) protocols from the search.

2. Missing function to guess a protocol based on the port number, when no protocol was found.

3. Missing "first guess" to start examinating packets from a protocol, which fits regarding the port numbers.

4. Debug functions do not work so far.

5. Invoke dissectors only when needed in a tree.

6. All the processing functions from original .c files in this directory.

7. Add ability to include user-defined protocols without prior re-compilation of the software.

8. Change the structure to include HTTPS as well:
SSL->HTTPS->Dropbox
SSL->POPS

9. Add proper certificates for TOR and other applications.

10. Multiple contents / services per flow.

11. Content and service providers

12. Custom content types and providers for non defined domsins and fields.

13. Excluding protocols by a bitmask.

14. Make it working in Windows / Linux kernel.

15. The scanning process should stop when:
- either all the scanners are already excluded
- or every level is already detected.
But sometimes some results from some scanners should be overwritten by another scanners, just by not excluding the levels.
Make it conssitent in ndpi_main.c and the calling sample application.

16. From protocols_osdpi.h remove all protocols which are not included in nDPIng. Afterwards, publish the list of supported protocols in README.
