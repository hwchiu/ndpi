This is an example Linux application, which demonstrates how to use the nDPIng
library.

In order to compile the example application, type "make".

The application uses the "flows" directory, which contains flows generated
by various applications and representing various protocols, types of the
content, and services. Each PCAP file in this directory contain exactly one flow.
The flows are truncated after the 20th packet. However, this example application
supports multiple flows per PCAP file.

In order to capture packets from an interface, you need to:

1. Edit #defines.
- #define LIVE_CAPTURE -> set to 1.
- #define LIVE_CAPTURE_PACKETS -> the capture will be taking place unless this
number of packets is captured.
- #define LIVE_CAPTURE_INTERFACE -> set it to the interface used for capture.

2. Re-compile the source code (make).

3. Runt it using superuser privileges (change to root).
