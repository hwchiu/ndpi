This is an example Linux application, which demonstrates how to use the nDPIng
library.

In order to compile the example application, type "make".

The application uses the "flows" directory, which contains flows generated
by various applications and representing various protocols, types of the
content, and services. Each PCAP file contain exactly one flow. The flows are
truncated after the 20th packet.

In the real-life scenario, when capturing the traffic from the network, the
user's application is responsible for building the flows using the 5-tuple
and providing the flows to the nDPIng library (the situation was exactly the
same with original nDPI). Therefore, here, to simplify the scenario, each flow
is contained by a separate PCAP file.
